# Paper-Scissors-Rock
A simple paper scissors rock game, first project using html, css, javascript

This is my first proper project writing in HTML, Css, and Javascript. 
While I have dabbled in this stuff before its been awhile, currently I am writing this on 12/10/2020, I have almost finished my second sememster of Computer Science and this is a way for me to use my knowledge that I have picked up and put it into projects. 

The code is a bit messy, I understand how the code all works but I am use to writing in Python so while I adjust it may be a bit messy, hopefully I will come back and tidy this all up.
